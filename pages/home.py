In these tasks, I widely use, among others: dash and pyomo packages.'),

        'The unit commitment problem (UC) in electrical power production is a large family of mathematical optimization problems where the production of a set of electrical generators is coordinated in order to achieve some common target, usually either matching the energy demand at minimum cost or maximizing revenue from electricity production. This is necessary because it is difficult to store electrical energy on a scale comparable with normal consumption; hence, each (substantial) variation in the consumption must be matched by a corresponding variation of the production.'

You can add, remove and modify the parameters of subsequent types of units: utility power plants (coal, gas and nuclear), batteries, renewable sources (wind and photovoltaic farms) and demand sources. Then you can check the daily cost of electricity production and the energy production profile of individual units, ranked according to their variable cost of energy production.'),
